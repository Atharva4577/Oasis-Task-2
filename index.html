                    international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat came to the fore in an innings of 148 runs
                    against Pakistan in his fifth international match. Within a year he joined the India Test team,

                    <li>
                        The explosion of T20 cricket on the Indian subcontinent paved the way for the formation of the
                        Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008. In the league’s inaugural season, Dhoni signed with the
                        Chennai Super Kings for $1.5 million, which at the time was the largest contract in the IPL. He
                        subsequently led the team to two consecutive titles (2010, 2011).
                    <li>
                        Dhoni took over the captaincy of the one-day side in 2007 and
                        led India to the Twenty20 (T20) world title. Series wins over Australia and Sri Lanka, among
                        others,
                        moved India to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings for the first
                        time
                        in December 2009.

                    <li>
                        In the 2011 one-day World Cup, Dhoni’s dashing innings of 91 not out—in
                        front of a home crowd in Mumbai—paved the way for India’s victory over Sri Lanka in the final.
                        He
                        also led India to an appearance in the semifinals of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Dhoni stopped
                        serving as India’s captain in 2017, having led his country in 331 international matches, the
                        most
                        for a captain in the sport’s history. Three years later he retired from international
                        competition.
